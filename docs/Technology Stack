What weâ€™re using:
Express
React	
Potential alternatives:
Flask, Gonic
Angular

Reasoning:
React is the most used/documented resource for building front-end applications. 
Additionally, React is what we have the most experience with as a group.
One reason for choosing express would be that it uses javascript and keeps all the code in one language allowing us to avoid data type conversions. 
Express allows for the easy integration of APIs in web applications. 
It's also easy to connect to databases and includes middleware modules 
that can perform additional tasks on request and response and a quicker I/O implies a speedy response to the user requests.
