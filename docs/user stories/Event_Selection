As a user, I want easy access to a calendar, so that I can choose a date with my friend to watch a movie together. 
    There will be an interactive calendar. Each user can add their respective availability and the app will find the 
    earliest available date and various times for both users to watch the movie together. If there are no times that 
    work within the next month, the users are notified to edit their calendars if possible. Additionally, users could 
    link their google calendar and the app will provide a time that they can meet within that same month.
