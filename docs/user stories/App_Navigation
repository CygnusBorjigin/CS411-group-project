As a user, I want to be able to navigate through different aspects of the app, the matching page, profile page, social page, 
calendar page, list of matches, etc
    There should be a sidebar or header where users can locate and click to see 
    the different features and sections of the app. Each “section” of the app will 
    have its’ own button with a discernible symbol such that the user can rationally understand 
    what they are clicking on. Additionally, there should be text underneath each symbol corresponding 
    to a section that should aid the user in selecting a section.
