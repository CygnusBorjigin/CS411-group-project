As a user, I want to be able to sign in to my account. Once having completed the 'Create Account' user story:
    The user should see a login page that prompts them to enter the username/email and a password.
    After entering the users login information, they should be able to click a submit, or log-in, button. 
    If the user is found, they will be directed to the app's home page. If the user is not found, 
    they will be allowed to keep retrying until they have a valid username and password. 
    Additionally, as a user, I will have the option to log into the app with a Github account by clicking the 'login with GitHub' button.
