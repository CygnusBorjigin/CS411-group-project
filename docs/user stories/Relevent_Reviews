As a user, I would like to be able to view relevant tweets about the movie to gauge my interest in selecting the movie or not. 
Viewing the general publics thoughts on the movie would help me decide if I want to watch the given movie.
Regardless of the movie, all movies will have relevant tweets available on their screen for the user to 
scroll through in order to formulate a decision.
