As a user, I want to swipe through movies with my friend, so that we can be “matched” on a movie.
    There is a UI that displays movie titles and a movie poster where users can “swipe” on movies 
    by clicking the right or left arrow OR by clicking on the left or right side of the screen. 
    Once the user clicks right/left on a movie, that movie is replaced with a new movie in which 
    the user repeats the process. Swiping right on the movie will indicate that it is a “liked”  movie 
    while swiping left will indicate that it is not a liked movie. The database will maintain a record 
    of these interactions so that when two or more linked users like the same movie, they will be notified of the connection.
