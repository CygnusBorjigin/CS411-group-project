As a logged in user, I want to add friends to my profile, so that I can determine what movie to watch with them.
Within the social tab of the app, there is a search box to find other users. If the user does not exist, it will 
display “Not Found.” If the user does exist, there is a button to add them as a friend on their profile. Once user
A adds user B as a friend, user B would need to accept the request in order for them to be connected. If user B 
rejects the request, then user A would need to submit another request if they would like to try connecting again.
