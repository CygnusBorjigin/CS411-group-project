As a user, I want to see who my friends, so that I can request to watch a movie with them.
    Within the social tab of the app, the user should be able to view who they are friends 
    with on the app. From there, they can send their friends or friend group a request to 
    start a new movie session. If the user would like to send a request to watch a movie 
    with a group, there should be a button for the user to click to request more than 1 friend. 
    If accepted, they will be able to swipe for movies within that session. If the request is not
    accepted, then they would need to submit another request if they would like to try connecting again.
    See the add friends to profile story for more information on the social aspect.
