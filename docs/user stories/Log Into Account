As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account.
    The user should see a login page that prompts them to enter the username/email and a password. 
    When entering their password, the user can choose whether it is visible or not while typing it. 
    After entering the users login information, they should be able to click a submit, or log-in, button. 
    If the user is found, they will be directed to the app's home page. If the user is not found, 
    they will be notified that they entered a wrong username and password.
