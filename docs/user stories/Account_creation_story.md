As a user, I want to be able to see what movies I have swiped on.
    Users should have a page where they can see all the movies they have swiped on. Have the option to sort by date swiped, genre, etc. If a user changes their mind on a movie, they should be able to change their current status to the opposite(liked to disliked and vice versa).


As a user, I want easy access to a calendar, so that I can choose a date with my friend to watch a movie together. 
    There will be an interactive calendar. Each user can add their respective availability and the app will find the earliest available date and various times for both users to watch the movie together. If there are no times that work within the next month, the users are notified to edit their calendars if possible. Additionally, users could link their google calendar and the app will provide a time that they can meet within that same month.
