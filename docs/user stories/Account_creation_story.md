As a user, I want to see more information about a specific movie that I am swiping through.
    As a user is swiping through movies to watch, one should be able to swipe up on a movie to find out important information about the movie such as ratings, genre, length, and a synopsis. The user should also be able to see what streaming services the movie is available on in order to know if they have access to that particular streaming service.

As a user, I want to be able to see what movies I have swiped on.
    Users should have a page where they can see all the movies they have swiped on. Have the option to sort by date swiped, genre, etc. If a user changes their mind on a movie, they should be able to change their current status to the opposite(liked to disliked and vice versa).


As a user, I want easy access to a calendar, so that I can choose a date with my friend to watch a movie together. 
    There will be an interactive calendar. Each user can add their respective availability and the app will find the earliest available date and various times for both users to watch the movie together. If there are no times that work within the next month, the users are notified to edit their calendars if possible. Additionally, users could link their google calendar and the app will provide a time that they can meet within that same month.
