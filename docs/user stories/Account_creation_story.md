As a user, I want to be able to navigate through different aspects of the app, the matching page, profile page, social page, calendar page, list of matches, etc
    There should be a sidebar or header where users can locate and click to see the different features and sections of the app. Each “section” of the app will have its’ own button with a discernible symbol such that the user can rationally understand what they are clicking on. Additionally, there should be text underneath each symbol corresponding to a section that should aid the user in selecting a section. 
    
As a user, I want to swipe through movies with my friend, so that we can be “matched” on a movie.
    There is a UI that displays movie titles and a movie poster where users can “swipe” on movies by clicking the right or left arrow OR by clicking on the left or right side of the screen. Once the user clicks right/left on a movie, that movie is replaced with a new movie in which the user repeats the process. Swiping right on the movie will indicate that it is a “liked”  movie while swiping left will indicate that it is not a liked movie. The database will maintain a record of these interactions so that when two or more linked users like the same movie, they will be notified of the connection.

As a user, I want to see more information about a specific movie that I am swiping through.
    As a user is swiping through movies to watch, one should be able to swipe up on a movie to find out important information about the movie such as ratings, genre, length, and a synopsis. The user should also be able to see what streaming services the movie is available on in order to know if they have access to that particular streaming service.

As a user, I want to be able to see what movies I have swiped on.
    Users should have a page where they can see all the movies they have swiped on. Have the option to sort by date swiped, genre, etc. If a user changes their mind on a movie, they should be able to change their current status to the opposite(liked to disliked and vice versa).


As a user, I want easy access to a calendar, so that I can choose a date with my friend to watch a movie together. 
    There will be an interactive calendar. Each user can add their respective availability and the app will find the earliest available date and various times for both users to watch the movie together. If there are no times that work within the next month, the users are notified to edit their calendars if possible. Additionally, users could link their google calendar and the app will provide a time that they can meet within that same month.
