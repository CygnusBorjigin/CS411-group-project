# Idea 1

  This idea revolves around forming a sort of tinder but for movies, in that you can link to a friend/friend groups’ id or significant other’s id and then upvote or downvote movies, with the app matching you when there’s a movie that you’ve both upvoted. We will make use of a database to maintain the relationships between users and user profiles. For APIs, we will use at least the IMDB API for movie information, the Twitter API to show tweets related to each movie, and maybe some kind of calendar/event api. In terms of third party authentication, we will maybe tie in Google accounts or Twitter. 


# Idea 2

A sort of "when to meet" app except instead of putting in all your available times, it uses your and your friends google calendars to find a free time for all of you to hang out. It also uses the weather api to account for days with bad weather and returns an optimal date to hang out on. Additionally, we could make it kind of always active, sending everyone a notification every couple weeks or so such as “here’s a date to hang out on."
